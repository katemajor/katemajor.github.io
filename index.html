        <div class="lead"><p>A tarot reading is a visual map of your soul at this time in your life’s journey. Tarot shows you the new opportunites that lay within the heart of any situation you find yourself in; whether it is related to issues concerning life-purpose, partner, family, career, finances, health or your spiritual path.</p><p>Every reader has their own style. Here is the style I have cultivated over the years.</p><p>I view the cards as extensions of <strong><em>your own wisdom</em></strong>. &nbsp;At it's core, a reading shows you how to find the flow and harmony in all things for greater clarity, peace and ease of living.</p><p>For a reading to do its magic in your life, I will often recommend simple practices you can do at home.  When a client returns and says, “I did what you suggested, and things worked out as you described them in the reading”, there is far more than fortune-telling going on. The client is experiencing an active alignment of their actions to the higher calling of their soul. In other words, they are connected with their flow.<br></p><p>Seeing new possibilities laid out on the table in picture form gives you the extra boost of confidence you need to take new steps. &nbsp;When you change the way you do things, including the way you interpret your challenges, the parts of your life you were frustrated with or saddened by start to change as well. The internal pressure is relieved and healthy growth takes place.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p><strong>A 60 minute reading is $100</strong>. When readings extend beyond this time,  there is a $10 charge every 10 minutes. Most readings are between 60 and 90 minutes, depending on how indepth the reading takes us. In the longer reading, there is an opportunity to peek at your palms and see how the overall direction of your life, as revealed by the palms, intertwines with the immediate concerns for which the Tarot is supberbly suited for.</p><p>Readings for home parties, bridal showers, special events or corporate functions are between 10/20 minutes and  the cost is $25/$45, per person. Each event is unique and you can call me to discuss the details of your requirements.</p><p><em><strong>To Book Your Appointment </strong>call me at <strong>403-652-3525 </strong>or email:<strong>majorarcana50@hotmail.com</strong> &nbsp;</em></p><p>If&nbsp;you call, we can have a short chat about the reasons you would like a reading and I can begin the process of tuning into the supportive energies within and around you. &nbsp;A reading can usually be arranged within 3 days. Readings are done by phone, easy to set up video call, or the traditional way--- in person.<br></p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p>Are you interested in learning how to read for yourself or others?&nbsp;<br></p><p>
Has anyone ever told you that you would be a very good tarot reader or considered offering readings but lack the training or confidence?&nbsp;</p><p>
I have plans to teach Tarot through video classes online as well as continue teaching in person. Those who want to learn for their own enjoyment as well as people who feel called to become readers themselves will benefit from my classes. I also plan to create a membership site, where we can meet on line to continue our personal and spiritual growth using the tool of Tarot. Coming January 2019.</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to be one of the first to preview the online course for <strong>free</strong>, send me an email, expressing your interest in the free preveiw and your level of experience. Everyone is welcome.</p></div>
